Simple smart home command line program for traineeship @Skyline Communications

To Do:
- Fix ASCII room display 
- Add a feature with json files to "remember" created houses, rooms and sensors
- Figure more stuff to do 

Done:
- Changed the sensors class so theres 3 base sensors, and user can define more (name, measuring unit, optimal range)
- Changed the room class so at first it has the default sensors, user can add sensors after creating the rooms
- Changed the room and house class so that user can add more rooms later on
- Fixed the issue with the program having mismatch errors but continuing to work, added input validations
